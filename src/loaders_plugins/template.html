  <!-- script will be added here using <script defer> 
  What's the difference between defer and async?
  
  They are both asynchronous meaning scripts are fetched while dom tree is being parsed.
  async: scripts will be executed once it's download. It's blocking and order is not guaranteed
  defer: scripts will be executed after dom is parsed. Order is guaranteed. It uses the order of the scripts
